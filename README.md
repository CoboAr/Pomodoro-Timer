The secret to efficient time management is to think in terms of tomatoes rather than hours. The Pomodoro Technique may appear goofy at first, yet millions of people swear by its life-changing impact.

Pomodoro-Timer is implented using tkinter python library.
Try the Pomodoro Technique if you:
<ul>
  <li>Find little distractions often derail the whole workday</li>
  <li>Consistently work past the point of optimal productivity</li>
  <li>Have lots of open-ended work that could take unlimited amounts of time (e.g., studying for an exam, researching a blog post, etc.)</li>
  <li>Are overly optimistic when it comes to how much you can get done in a day (aren't we all üôÉ)</li>
  <li>Enjoy gamified goal-setting</li>
  <li>Really like tomatoes</li>
</ul>
